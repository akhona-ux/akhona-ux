Heyy ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**akhona-ux/akhona-ux** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm an 18-years-old with a passion for coding and a dream of becoming a software developer. I'm super excited to start my journey in the tech world.
Ever since I wrote my first line of code in Grade 10, I've been hooked! There's something magical about bringing ideas to life through code.
It's like a superpower.

I'm starting with an introductory programming course in March, and I can't wait to dive deeper into the field. I'm eager to use my skills to make a real
imapact and build a successful career. I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting projects to work on. If you have any ideas, please let me know.
When I'm not coding you can find me curled up with a good rom-com book and exploring new coding concepts just for fun. I'm always eager to learn from 
other developers

I'm excited to see what the future holds and to connect with you all!
